## ▶️ Deploy

```powershell
cd deployment
.\deploy-foundry-env.ps1
```

Optional Teams-driven flow:

```powershell
cd deployment
.\deploy-foundry-env.ps1 -UseTeamsChatFlow
```

The script will:

1. 🔑 Resolve subscription IDs dynamically by name (`zolab` and `Security`)
2. 👥 Create the `zolab-ai-dev` Entra security group (or reuse if it exists)
3. 👤 Add the deploying user to the `zolab-ai-dev` group (if not already a member)
4. 🧠 Prompt the user to choose one of four allowed AI model choices (`gpt-4.1-mini`, `gpt-5.3`, `gpt-5.4`, `grok-4-1-fast-reasoning`) from a menu
5. ✅ Validate the selected model against regional availability before deployment, prompting again from the remaining options if needed
6. 🎲 Generate a random 6-char alphanumeric suffix (supports multiple deployments per subscription)
7. 🏗️ Deploy all Foundry resources via Bicep to a new `zolab-ai-<suffix>` resource group
8. 🔒 Assign RBAC roles to the `zolab-ai-dev` group and the Foundry managed identity
9. 📊 Configure diagnostic settings on Key Vault and Blob Storage
10. 📡 Assign Log Analytics Reader on DIBSecCom workspace in the Security subscription

When `-UseTeamsChatFlow` is enabled, the script creates or reuses a self-owned Teams group chat named `Microsoft Foundry Deployments`, prompts for the model selection in that chat, waits for a valid reply, and posts the final build success/failure notification there. Reply with either the menu number or the model name.
The same Teams chat also receives a complete teardown status report after cleanup operations when `-UseTeamsChatFlow` is used.

Microsoft Graph requirements for this flow:

- Sign in to Microsoft Graph with the DIB tenant account that will operate the chat flow (`agent007@bondent.onmicrosoft.com`).
- Teams chat permissions required for both the build script and the listener:
  - `User.Read`
  - `Chat.Create`
  - `Chat.ReadWrite`
  - `ChatMessage.Send`
- Additional deployment permissions still required by `deploy-foundry-env.ps1` because it manages the `zolab-ai-dev` Entra group:
  - `Group.ReadWrite.All`
  - `GroupMember.ReadWrite.All`

Helpful notes:

- The scripts reconnect with `Connect-MgGraph -ContextScope CurrentUser`, so once you consent these scopes they can be reused by later sessions under the same Windows profile.
- The automation intentionally uses a self-owned **group chat** named `Microsoft Foundry Deployments`; that is the supported pattern for this workflow.
- If you change listener command handling, restart the detached listener so the running process picks up the new code.
- Use `listener status` after startup to confirm the listener is online with the expected account, chat topic, PID, and current UTC time.

### Teams Command Listener

```powershell
cd deployment
.\teams-command-dispatch.ps1
```

Once the listener is running, send one of these commands in the Teams chat:

- `build it`
- `list builds`
- `build status 'zolab-ai-6bmycg'`
- `teardown 'zolab-ai-6bmycg'`
- `listener status`
- `?`
- `stop listener`

The listener validates the request, then asks for confirmation:

- Build: reply `1` to build or `2` to abort
- List builds: no confirmation required
- Build status: reply `1` to confirm or `2` to abort
- Teardown: reply `1` to confirm teardown or `2` to abort
- Listener status / `?`: no confirmation required

By default, the confirmation prompt stays open for 30 minutes before it expires.
After each confirmed build or teardown, the listener sends the full status report back to the Teams chat.
The listener stays online until you explicitly send `stop listener` in the Teams chat.
Use `?` any time to get the current command list, and use `listener status` for a quick health snapshot that reports the online indicator, account, chat topic, PID, and current UTC time.

Upon completion, the script outputs all resource names and writes `build_info-<suffix>.json` at the repo root for notebook configuration.

- 🌐 **Foundry Project Endpoint** — stored in `build_info-<suffix>.json` as `foundry_project_endpoint` and loaded by the Win11 notebook into `foundry_proj_ep`
- 🤖 **Model Endpoint** — stored in `build_info-<suffix>.json` as `azure_openai_endpoint`
- 🧠 **Model Name** — stored in `build_info-<suffix>.json` as `genai_model` and used by the notebook when creating the agent

The generated `build_info-<suffix>.json` includes:

- `rg`
- `appinsights`
- `foundry_project_endpoint`
- `azure_openai_endpoint`
- `storage_account`
- `key_vault`
- `genai_model`
- `foundry_name`
- `foundry_project_name`

## 🧹 Cleanup

```powershell
cd deployment
.\deploy-foundry-env.ps1 -Cleanup
```

Target a single deployment resource group:

```powershell
cd deployment
.\deploy-foundry-env.ps1 -Cleanup -CleanupResourceGroup zolab-ai-6bmycg
```

Cleanup will:

1. ❌ Remove all RBAC role assignments for `zolab-ai-dev` (both subscriptions)
2. 🗑️ Delete the `zolab-ai-<suffix>` resource group and all resources within it
3. 🧼 Purge soft-deleted Cognitive Services accounts (prevents redeploy conflicts)
4. 📋 Remove subscription-level deployment records from both subscriptions
5. ✅ Preserve the `zolab-ai-dev` Entra group (not deleted)

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Key values are resolved at runtime in `deploy-foundry-env.ps1`:

```powershell
$subscriptionId         = (Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "zolab").Id
$securitySubscriptionId = (Get-AzSubscription -SubscriptionName "Security").Id
$location               = "eastus2"
$groupDisplayName       = "zolab-ai-dev"
```

No hardcoded subscription GUIDs — subscriptions are looked up by display name.

---

## 📝 Notes

- The resource group suffix is **randomly generated** at deploy time — each run creates a unique environment, allowing multiple deployments within a single subscription.
- The deploying user is automatically added to the `zolab-ai-dev` Entra group.
- The `zolab-ai-dev` group is created once and persists across cleanup/redeploy cycles.
- Diagnostic settings send **all logs** (not metrics) to the centralized DIBSecCom Log Analytics Workspace for security observability.
- Key Vault uses `AzureDiagnostics` destination type for compatibility with Sentinel analytics rules.
